🕵️‍♂️ Credit Card Fraud Detection
  🔍 Overview
    This project uses machine learning to detect fraudulent transactions in credit card data. It includes data preprocessing, visualization, handling class imbalance using SMOTE, model training using Logistic Regression, and model evaluation. The dataset contains anonymized credit card transactions and a binary fraud label.

🚀 Features
  Clean and preprocess transaction data
  
  Visualize fraud vs. non-fraud transactions
  
  Handle extreme class imbalance using SMOTE
  
  Train and evaluate a Logistic Regression classifier
  
  Confusion matrix and metrics analysis
  
  Plots and screenshots for clarity


📦 Tech Stack

📈 Workflow
  Load Dataset
  Read the dataset and inspect the structure.
  
  Visualize Imbalance
  View the imbalance between fraud and normal transactions.
  
  Preprocessing
  Drop unnecessary fields and prepare the data.
  
  Balance with SMOTE
  Apply SMOTE to generate synthetic samples for the minority (fraud) class.
  
  Train the Model
  Train a logistic regression model on the balanced data.
  
  Model Evaluation
  Use a confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate


💡 Future Enhancements
  Try models like Random Forest, XGBoost
  
  Integrate hyperparameter tuning
  
  Build a live dashboard or web interface
  
  Save model and deploy via REST API
